      <p class="mt-0">The academic statement of purpose and personal statement should cover details about your academic background and career aspirations. You will want to talk about your engineering experiences, your motivation for pursuing a higher degree in Robotics, your long-term goals, as well as your specific interests.</p>

      <p>The pair of separate statements should work together to inform us about your experiences and goals. However, don't be redundant. Utilize the personal statement to expand upon your academic statement of purpose. If you want to write about the same topic, split it into two distinct pieces that cover different thoughts. Please note that once an applicant submits their online application, no changes to the statement of purpose, personal statement, curriculum vitae, and application can be modified online.</p>

      <p><strong>Format Guidelines</strong>: There are no formatting guidelines in regards to font type, font size, or margins. This format is meant to be flexible and allow for creativity: there is no single answer, however, below is more guidance on each statement.</p>

      <h2>Academic Statement of Purpose</h2>

      <p>Focus on your technical background and go deep:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Describe your engineering experience in detail, whether through internships, projects, or research. Highlight your specific contributions.</li>
        <li>Explain your academic and research background, career goals, and how this graduate program aligns with your objectives.</li>
        <li>Show your enthusiasm for your field and showcase strong technical writing. Make clear why graduate school is your next step, what unique strengths you bring, and what you hope to contribute.</li>
        <li>Also, identify which Robotics Department faculty members you want to work with, and explain why their work interests you, and why you think you'd be a good fit in their research group.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Length</strong>: About one to two pages, single spaced.</p>

      <h2>Personal Statement</h2>

      <p>Share your personal story and motivation:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Discuss how your background and life experiences—social, cultural, family, education, challenges, or opportunities—inspired your decision to pursue graduate study at U-M.</li>
        <li>Explain what drives you, including key academic or non-academic experiences that have prepared you. Mention collaborators or mentors if relevant, and describe your work with them.</li>
        <li>Treat this as a story of your personal and professional development, including why graduate school fits into your journey and your goals for the future.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Length</strong>: The personal statement should be approximately one to two pages, single spaced. Rackham's 500 word limit does not apply.</p>
