      <p class="text-xl">Michigan Robotics is committed to providing its members with an environment filled with integrity, enthusiasm, and respect. We value everyone.</p>

      <p>In addition, the value of one's work will be based on scientific ability and contributions to the community, and not on one's appearance, race, color, national origin, age, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, disability, religion, height, weight, or veteran status.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-roboto-condensed font-bold text-umichblue dark:text-white">The three values of Michigan Robotics</h2>

      <p>In order to achieve our desired community, we call on all members to be helpful to others, and adhere to the following values:</p>
      <div class="space-y-8">
        <div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row items-start gap-2 md:gap-8 card-base surface card-padded border-l-4 border-maize">

              <span class="border-b-4 border-maize">Robotics with respect</span>
            </h3>
            <p class="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-200 text-lg">As a robotics community focused on serving society, we work to create a world where everyone is treated with dignity and respect, from our labmates to communities much different than our own. We listen, and we pursue robotics for good and for everyone.</p>

            </h3>
            <p class="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-200 text-lg">Our fundamental belief that robots can improve people's quality of life mandates that we work together to eliminate the barriers to the field of robotics and empower all to access, and excel in, robotics.</p>

            </h3>
            <p class="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-200 text-lg">As any field of technology, robotics has the leverage to greatly shape our future, and our honest, fair, and ethical actions here will help such behavior become the expectation everywhere.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-umichblue dark:text-white">On respect</h3>
      <p class="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300 mt-4">Treating one another with respect also means understanding that we each bring an array of skills and perspectives to Robotics and hold different levels of responsibility and power. The empowered members of our community must be especially cognizant of the even higher standard of conduct that is required of that role, and understand the sense of vulnerability that members with less power, especially students, may feel. Students deserve our highest respect.</p>
      <p class="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300 mt-4">Our work, the hardware and software that compose our robots, acts as an extension of our own values. As such, we also need to ensure that our designs, programming, building, testing, and the actual function of our robots treat humans and human interactions with respect.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-umichblue dark:text-white">On outreach</h3>
      <p class="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300 mt-4">Through outreach, we hope to inspire future students to change the world through robotics, we hope to inform responsible policy that positively impacts society, and we hope to help the general public accurately understand robotics.</p>
      <p class="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300 mt-4">This enthusiastic outreach can look different for each person. It might mean working on code to share with an online community, or teaching robotics at an event attended by 70,000 grade schoolers. Both represent vital work that strengthens the Michigan Robotics community and robotics in general.</p>
      <p class="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300 mt-4">And even within our community, we must reach out to one another and offer our varied expertise and experience, which will help create both more robust robotics and roboticists.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-umichblue dark:text-white">On integrity</h3>
      <p class="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300 mt-4">Especially in robotics, where fiction can intertwine with what has actually been achieved in a lab, it is important to report our actual success and failure as we create smart machines. Even outside of the lab, integrity is vital in our work, and while it might be tested by othersâ€™ demands or actions, we must adhere to what is right.</p>
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-roboto-condensed font-bold text-umichblue dark:text-white">Practicing our values</h2>
      
      <p>Students who go above-and-beyond in representing these values through outreach service are awarded the Robotics Outreach Ambassador award, and students can practice these values through many outreach opportunities.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-umichblue dark:text-white">Activities that exemplify our values include:</h3>
