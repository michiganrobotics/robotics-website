                <p class="mb-6 md:mt-0">Opened in 2021, the Ford Robotics building is the home of Michigan Robotics. The 134,000-square-foot, four-story complex houses classrooms, offices, a cafe, and a startup-style open collaboration area and tailored lab space for a variety of robotic technologies. A few highlights include:</p>

				<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
					<li>Three-story fly zone for autonomous aerial vehicles</li>
					<li>An outdoor obstacle course for walking robots</li>
					<li>High-bay garage space for self-driving cars</li>
					<li>A rehabilitation lab with a Stewart platform, force plates, and dual-tread treadmill</li>
					<li>A robotics maker space with CNC, 3D printers, soldering irons, and other shop tools</li>
					<li>A 10,000 gallon research water tank with motion capture cameras for marine robotics</li>
					<li>An outdoor Mars Yard with imitation martian rocks and soil for testing rovers</li>
					<li>Earned Gold LEED Certification for its construction and design</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="mb-6">And in a unique agreement, Ford leases the fourth floor to perform robotics research and engineering in collaboration with U-M and other industry leaders.</p>

				<h2>What is its purpose?</h2>
				<p class="mb-4">The Ford Robotics Building brings all parts of the robotics enterprise together for real-world results.</p>

				<p class="mb-4">The new building is designed to promote collaborative work across disciplines, involving students and faculty at all levels, from a variety of fields. It also promotes collaboration with external partners, including the Ford Motor Company, who have a permanent presence on site. It has spaces for teaching, experimentation, and testing, in purpose-built bays and laboratories that represent the state of the art.</p>

				<p class="mb-4">These facilities support a particularly distinctive characteristic of Michigan Robotics: its focus on hardware as well as software.</p>

				<p class="mb-4">Michigan Robotics emphasizes making real robots. Many roboticists specialize in simulations, but implementing a real machine in the real world poses real challenges. These new spaces enable Michigan roboticists to take full advantage of their hands-on orientation in research and teaching, as they work to build machines that better society.</p>

		<h2 class="mt-12 mb-4">In a next-level neighborhood</h2>
		<p class="mb-4">Among the many facilities open to Michigan Robotics students, faculty, and researchers, several provide unique opportunities to develop technologies safely, nimbly, and creatively.</p>

		<p class="mb-4">The <a href="/about/facilities/m-air-net/">M-Air Net</a> is a 10,000 sq ft, four-story, netted scientific facility that enables the study of autonomy and collaborative robotics in the "wild," with emphasis on dealing with the full range of Michigan weather, -30C to 38C, with rain, sleet, wind, and snow.</p>

		<p class="mb-4"><a href="https://mcity.umich.edu">Mcity</a> is a public-private partnership that operates the world's first purpose-built proving ground for testing the performance and safety of connected and automated vehicles and technologies under controlled and realistic conditions, all on the Michigan campus.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">And the College of Engineering and University of Michigan have <a href="https://www.engin.umich.edu/research/labs-facilities/">an astounding array of additional world-class facilities</a>, including a nanofabrication lab, wind tunnels, a battery lab, and more.</p>
