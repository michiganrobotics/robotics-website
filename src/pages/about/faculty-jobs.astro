      <div class="prose dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
<p>The Robotics Department in the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor invites applications for two faculty that will join our mission to accelerate advances in robotics for the benefit of society. Successful candidates will have a relevant doctorate or equivalent experience and an outstanding record of achievement and impactful research in academia, industry, and/or at national laboratories. They will have a strong record of commitment to teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels and to providing service to the university and to the profession.</p>

<p>The Robotics Department seeks to fill two tenure-track faculty positions. The first position is open to faculty of all ranks and invites candidates across all research areas relevant to robotics to apply. Candidates in the areas of Robot Learning, Robot Vision, Robot Perception, Medical Robotics, and Aerial Robotics are especially encouraged to apply. The second position seeks faculty who are either tenured or have at least five years of experience doing research in industry, and whose research focuses on the area of Human-Centered Embodied AI.</p>
