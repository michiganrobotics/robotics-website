Welcome and thank you for your interest in applying to our graduate program. While reviewing applications, we always consider the applicant as a whole, giving time to thoughtfully consider each portion of the application. Admission to the graduate program is determined by the Robotics faculty. The Rackham Graduate School acts as the administrative body overseeing the admissions process.

While we do look for a strong academic preparation, we also focus on those we determine would be a good match at Michigan. An engineering background is recommended but not required for the Robotics graduate program, although we have found that the lack of engineering background can put students at a disadvantage as they begin their graduate studies. In general, our Admissions Committee is most interested in undergraduate and/or graduate academic performance, research experience, letters of recommendation (with particular attention to letters coming from faculty in relevant fields) and the academic statement of purpose.

* If you have any questions or issues with the online application, please contact Rackham Admissions at [rackadmis@umich.edu](mailto:rackadmis@umich.edu).  
* If you have any other questions, please contact our Student Services Office at [robotics-sso@umich.edu](mailto:robotics-sso@umich.edu) or 734-763-2369.

### GRE scores policy 

For applications for Fall 2023 and beyond, GRE scores will not be accepted with PhD applications. For applicants to the MS program, submitting GRE scores is optional. MS applicants are welcome to submit GRE scores, but they are not required to do so.
</Callout>

## Application deadlines 

Graduate applications are accepted for the fall term only and will become available typically in late August. Applications must be complete by the deadline; applications received after the deadline will not be considered. All materials are due as follows: 

| Application | Deadline | Admit Terms |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| PhD | December 1 | Fall only |
| Master’s | January 15  | Fall only |
| SUGS | October 1<br />January 15 | Winter<br />Fall |
| Change of Program | PhD: December 1<br />MS: January 15 | Fall only |
| Dual Degree | January 15  | Fall only |

## Admission decisions timeline 

Typically, admission decisions are communicated via email and are made on a rolling basis. Our admission offer goals are noted below: 

| Application | Typical time frame |
| :---- | :---- |
| PhD | Majority of offers will be made in February-March |
| Master’s | Mid-March |
| SUGS | Mid-March |
| Change of Program | Late-March |
| Dual Degree | Late-March |
| Denials | Early April |

Final decisions on admission are typically made by April 15\. If you are not accepted and you would like to apply for a future term, you must submit a new application. An application fee is required for each new application submission.

**Late materials**: We ask that all applicants submit all required application materials by the deadline. However, we understand that there might be a delay in the receipt of letters of recommendation, test scores or transcripts to arrive. Receiving application materials after the deadline may result in a delay of the items being processed and reviewed by the Graduate Admission Committee. 

## MS vs. PhD 

Apply to the master's program if you plan to end your studies at the master's level. The MS program typically takes 3-4 (Fall/Winter) semesters to complete, depending on how many credits are taken per term. 

Apply to the PhD program directly if you plan to pursue a PhD. If you do not currently hold a relevant master's degree, you will earn it during the first two years of the PhD program.  **Note**: PhD students are required to be enrolled full-time during the Fall and Winter semesters. 

If you are interested in both the PhD and Master's programs, you should apply to the PhD program. PhD applicants that are better suited to the master's program are automatically given some consideration for the MS program as well; you do not need to apply to both. You can also indicate on the PhD application if you wish to also be considered for the MS program.

## Criteria our admissions committee looks for

In general, our Admissions Committee is most interested in: 

* Undergraduate and graduate academic performance   
* Research experience   
* Letters of recommendation (with particular attention to letters coming from faculty in relevant fields)   
* The academic statement of purpose   
  
An engineering background is recommended but not required for admission into our program, with many students coming from mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science. However, we have found that the lack of an engineering background puts students at a disadvantage as they begin their graduate studies.
