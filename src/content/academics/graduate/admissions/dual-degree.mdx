## Non-Robotics Students seeking to add a Robotics Masterâ€™s Degree

The Robotics Department Graduate Committee will not admit dual degree applicants whose primary program offers a Robotics option (e.g. ECE and MECHENG).

### Admission Requirements:

2. A minimum cumulative Rackham GPA of at least 3.5 is required in order to apply for a dual degree in Robotics.

You must meet with your current program advisor or graduate coordinator to complete this form prior to submitting the application for dual admission.

## Deadlines

## Current Robotics Students Applying to Other Programs

Current Robotics Students interested in applying to a dual degree in other programs should first meet with the program of interest to learn their requirements.
