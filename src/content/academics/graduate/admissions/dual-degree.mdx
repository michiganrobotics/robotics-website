## Non-Robotics Students seeking to add a Robotics Masterâ€™s Degree

Current U-M graduate students in other programs may be eligible to earn a dual degree in Robotics. The Robotics Department Graduate Committee will not accept dual degree applications from students whose primary program offers a Robotics option (e.g. ECE and MECHENG).

### Admission Requirements & Procedures:

1. A minimum cumulative Rackham GPA of at least 3.5 is required in order to be accepted for a dual degree in Robotics.  
2. Must have completed and earned a B+ or better grade in ROB 501 and ROB 550.  
3. A completed [Pre-Approval Form for Dual Admission](https://rackham.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dual-admission-pre-approval-form.pdf). You must meet with your current program advisor or graduate coordinator for their signature approval prior to submitting the application for dual admission. The Pre-Approval Form is uploaded with your application.  
4. Submit the Rackham [Dual Admission application](https://applyweb.com/forms/umgdual). The required $10 application fee is payable via Visa or MasterCard.  
   

## Deadlines

Robotics only accepts applications for Fall term admission. The application deadline is January 15.

## Current Robotics Students Applying to Other Programs

Current Robotics Students interested in applying to a dual degree in other programs should first meet with the program of interest to learn their requirements. After completing section A of the [Pre-Approval Form for Dual Admission](https://rackham.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dual-admission-pre-approval-form.pdf) please submit the form to the Robotics Graduate Coordinator who will route the form to the Robotics Grad Chair (the Authorized Signer) for review.
