## Graduate Program Coordinator

University of Michigan - Ann Arbor students interested in learning about the Master's and PhD programs, and current Robotics Master's and PhD students, are able to make an advising appointment with the Robotics Graduate Coordinator Denise Edmund.

You can schedule an advising appointment with the graduate coordinator to discuss topics such as:
- Degree requirements and progress
- Navigating policies
- Referral to resources

We recommend connecting with your advisor at least once a semester for a degree audit and discussing your remaining degree requirements.
