## What graduate students do

<AnimatedActivities>

<div class="activity-card surface rounded-lg p-6 mb-6 break-inside-avoid">

### Learn the core concepts

The Michigan Robotics graduate program consists of three main technical areas, which converge as students produce functioning robots:

<div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6 items-start mb-8 pl-4">
  <div class="md:w-1/3 flex-shrink-0">
    <Image src={sensing} alt="Sensing" class="w-full h-48 object-cover rounded-md shadow-md hover:scale-105 transition-transform duration-300" />

    <Button href="/academics/graduate/degree-requirements/" text="Explore the degree" />
</div>

<div class="activity-card surface rounded-lg p-6 mb-6 break-inside-avoid">

### Conduct leading research
Graduate students work on fundamental and applied research problems that advance the field of robotics. Whether pursuing a Master's or PhD, students collaborate with faculty and industry partners on projects spanning our focus areas.

<ResearchScrollCarousel />

<Button href="/research/" text="Explore our research focus areas" class="mt-4" />

</div>

<div class="activity-card surface rounded-lg p-6 mb-6 break-inside-avoid">

### Publish, pitch, and present
Graduate students regularly publish their research in top-tier conferences and journals, establishing their reputation in the robotics community. They present their work at international conferences, such as IROS, ICRA, and RSS, building networks and gaining feedback from leading researchers worldwide.

Students also take advantage of the deep entrepreneurial and business programs available at Michigan through the College of Engineering and Ross School of Business to develop skills and market test ideas by pitching their innovations to industry partners, investors, and startup competitions, translating research into real-world applications.

</div>

<div class="activity-card surface rounded-lg p-6 mb-6 break-inside-avoid">

### Build community
Graduate students contribute to a vibrant robotics community through multiple channels:

<div class="mt-4">

* [Practicing our values](/about/values)
  <div class="-mt-4 text-sm">Championed originally by our students, the department values include *robotics with respect*, *enthusiastic outreach*, and *integrity in action*.</div>

* [Robotics Graduate Student Council](/academics/student-services/robotics-graduate-student-council) (RGSC)
  <div class="-mt-4 text-sm">Group that organizes social events, professional development workshops, peer support networks, and works with department leadership to improve the student experience.</div>

* [Outreach initiatives](/about/partnerships)
  <div class="-mt-4 text-sm">We regularly partner with community organizations to show off our work and inspire future roboticists, as well as celebrating those who take part in such community work.</div>

* Collaborate together and beyond
  <div class="-mt-4 text-sm">Our building and program were designed from the ground-up to foster cross-lab partnerships and interdisciplinary connections that strengthen the entire robotics ecosystem, with an expert in your problem just a desk, hall, or building away.</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="activity-card surface rounded-lg p-6 mb-6 break-inside-avoid">

### Teach and mentor
Graduate students gain valuable teaching experience by serving as graduate student instructors (GSIs) for undergraduate and graduate courses. This experience helps develop communication skills and provides insights into pedagogical approaches.

There are also opportunities to be a mentor for peers or undergraduates, and leadership training programs to gain differentiating skills and new approaches to working in a collaborative field.
