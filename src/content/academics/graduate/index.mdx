### Conduct cutting-edge research
Graduate students work on fundamental and applied research problems that advance the field of robotics. Whether pursuing a Master's or PhD, students collaborate with faculty and industry partners on projects spanning:

* **Autonomous Systems** - developing robots that can operate independently in complex, unstructured environments
* **Human-Robot Interaction** - creating intuitive and safe interactions between humans and robotic systems
* **Machine Learning & AI** - advancing robot perception, planning, and learning capabilities
* **Bio-inspired Robotics** - drawing inspiration from biological systems to create novel robotic solutions

<Button href="/research/" text="Explore our research" class="mt-4" />

</div>

<div class="activity-card surface rounded-lg p-6 mb-6 break-inside-avoid">

### Collaborate across disciplines
Robotics inherently requires expertise from multiple fields. Graduate students work with researchers from computer science, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, psychology, and other disciplines to solve complex challenges.

Many students also participate in industry collaborations, giving them exposure to real-world applications and career opportunities while contributing to practical robotics solutions.

</div>

<div class="activity-card surface rounded-lg p-6 mb-6 break-inside-avoid">

### Teach and mentor
Graduate students gain valuable teaching experience by serving as graduate student instructors (GSIs) for undergraduate courses. This experience helps develop communication skills and provides insights into pedagogical approaches.

PhD students also mentor undergraduate researchers and junior graduate students, building leadership skills essential for future academic or industry careers.

</div>

<div class="activity-card surface rounded-lg p-6 mb-6 break-inside-avoid">

### Publish and present
Graduate students regularly publish their research in top-tier conferences and journals, establishing their reputation in the robotics community. They present their work at international conferences, building networks and gaining feedback from leading researchers worldwide.

The Michigan Robotics graduate program consists of <span class="text-arboretumBlue dark:text-maize font-semibold">three main technical areas</span>, which converge as students produce functioning robots:

      <p class="text-left">upon the body and environment to enable locomotion or interaction.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Each of these areas may be considered a subplan for coursework and research study.

Our students come to the field with a variety of backgrounds, particularly in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science. They learn to work in teams to accomplish the many tasks necessary to build and operate an autonomous system, including mechanical design, electronics, programming and integrating all the parts. Students graduate the program as independent researchers and engineers, and many will go on to become leaders in robotics research, academia, industry and government (see a few of our [alumni](/people/alumni/)).
