    ## Course Override Requests
    ### Undergraduate course override
    Undergraduate students looking to enroll in robotics courses who do not meet the enforced prerequisites can submit a request to enroll via the [Robotics Petition](https://deptapps.engin.umich.edu/petition/student/form?dept=210308). When submitting a petition for a course override, please include the course you are looking to enroll in and any relevant coursework you have completed.

    **Note:** Overrides for undergraduate core ROB courses (ROB 204; ROB 310; ROB 311; ROB 320; ROB 330; ROB 340) will not be issued to non-robotics majors until December 9th once everyone has had a chance to register.

    ### Graduate course approval
        400-level courses listed as electives in the Complete Course Listing, or any 500-level or higher courses within the College of Engineering, can be considered an elective.

    To request approval for courses not in these groups, [submit a course approval request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSci0XS8N5iMFAmnvBs2DBWWUwdGac9HoBrg536HpNfD4HLP4Q/viewform). Please allow at least 2 weeks for a response.
