Please use this as a resource while you plan your winter schedule. There are tabs for courses offered by our department, information related to our special topics courses, and an account for non-ROB courses that are being offered in the winter that can count for a Robotics undergraduate and/or graduate requirement.  
  
**Please note**: This information was pulled October 23rd and it's possible there may have been changes to offerings. The Course Guide is to be used as an additional reference to what is listed in the Atlas Schedule Builder and Wolverine Access.
