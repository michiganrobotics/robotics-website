Please use this as a resource while you plan your schedule for the semester. There are tabs for courses offered by our department, information related to our special topics courses, and an account for non-ROB courses that are being offered and count for a Robotics undergraduate and/or graduate requirement.

Please note: This information is pulled several weeks prior to the start of the term and it’s possible there may have been changes to offerings. The Course Guide is to be used as an additional reference to what is listed in the Atlas Schedule Builder and Wolverine Access.
