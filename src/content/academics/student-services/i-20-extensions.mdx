International students in F-1 and J-1 status can request an extension of their I-20 if additional time is needed to complete their degree.

### How do I extend my I-20?

1. Determine the reason for the I-20 extension.   
   * Unacceptable reasons for extension can be found on this page [(I-20 Extension Guidelines](https://internationalcenter.umich.edu/isss/current-students/extend-status)).  
2. Complete the additional documents on this page [(I-20 Extension Guidelines](https://internationalcenter.umich.edu/isss/current-students/extend-status)).  
3. Submit [this document](https://internationalcenter.umich.edu/sites/default/files/forms/I20-DS2019advisor-ext.pdf) to your Academic Advisor or Graduate Coordinator for completion by emailing robotics-sso@umich.edu.   
   * In the email, please provide the reason for the delay so your advisor can complete the form appropriately.  
4. *PhD students only*: To complete the funding letter the Graduate Coordinator will need the following:  
   * the student’s expected final term of enrollment
