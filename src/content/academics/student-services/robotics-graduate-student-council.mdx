## Mission

The RGSC strives to:

1. Foster an environment in which all students have a voice in their education and community. Ensure that voice is heard by coordinating with the students, the Â College of Engineering and Robotics leadership so that the goals of all three parties can be attained.

3. Create a community for all the graduate students in Robotics by organizing events that promote social interaction and a feeling of camaraderie among the students.

5. Support the professional and academic development of the students and alumni of Robotics.

7. Promote the growth of robotics and STEM fields as a whole through organizing and participating in community outreach and service.
