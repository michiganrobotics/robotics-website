## Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) Positions

### Overview
A GSI coordinates, leads, or assists in the instructional process in direct interaction with students. This can include class sessions, office hours, recitation, laboratory, quiz, or problem sessions. GSI positions are filled by both incoming and current graduate students. Doctoral students are given priority. GSIs are usually expected to work 16 to 20 hours per week, receiving full tuition and fees, monthly stipend, and university health care coverage.

### Application Timeline
The application is open approximately July and November each year. The link will be shared to all Robotics students: first PhD students, then MS students.

- Adjustments to the course you are assigned could occur based on department needs.
- It is very rare that newly admitted students receive a GSI during their first semester or year.
