To maintain accordance with student visa requirements, international students in F-1 and J-1 status are required to maintain full-time enrollment status during the school year (Fall and Winter terms). There are situations for which an exception can be requested and students can apply for a Reduced Course Load (RCL).

Visit the [International Center’s RCL website](https://internationalcenter.umich.edu/isss/enrollment/reduced-course-load) to learn important information, details, and the process for how to apply for a RCL.

Part of the application process is to request a RCL Recommendation Letter from your academic advisor or graduate coordinator. Please follow the instructions below to submit this request.

Instructions for reduced course load (RCL) letter:

1. Finalize your registration. We cannot provide the RCL letter until your record reflects the course(s) you will be completing.

3. Submit completed [MS Degree Worksheet](http://robotics.umich.edu/ms-degree-worksheet/)
4. Email [robotics-sso@umich.edu](mailto:robotics-sso@umich.edu) to request an RCL letter.
