Robotics Undergraduate Student Council (RUSC) is established for the expressed purpose of developing a community and supporting undergraduate students in the Robotics Department at the University of Michigan.

As a robotics student organization sponsored by the Undergraduate Department of Robotics, we support the program by:

- Supporting student-faculty feedback in academic coursework

- Creating outreach opportunities to serve a larger community

- Fostering an environment of equity

- Hosting professional and networking events 

- Bringing everyone together through social events to bring the robotics community together

All students declared as Undergraduate Robotics majors are considered to be eligible members of RUSC.
