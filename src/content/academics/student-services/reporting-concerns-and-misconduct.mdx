title: "Reporting concerns and misconduct"

If you encounter behavior or misconduct that does not follow Robotics [values](https://robotics.umich.edu/about/values/) or University of Michigan [policies](https://spg.umich.edu/), or are unsure if you have experienced such behavior, there are many resources and contacts available for you.

A key distinction in the available contacts, however, is whether the contact must share your concerns on prohibited behavior, including sexual assault, harassment, violence, stalking, or retaliation, with the University’s Equity, Civil Rights, and Title IX Office (ECRT) or whether the contact can keep your conversation confidential.

In addition, any university employee, including student and temporary employees, **must share concerns that they become aware of** in the context of their employment related to prohibited behavior, including sexual assault, harassment, violence, stalking, or retaliation, with ECRT.

## To maintain confidentiality

To discuss your concerns with someone who *can* guarantee confidentiality, contact:

## Maintaining respect and integrity

As stated in our values, we strive for a community built on respect and integrity. Actions against those values do not only hurt our community members, but weaken our community and what we can achieve as a whole. While reporting misconduct is up to those who encounter it, we hope everyone feels comfortable pointing out instances of wrongdoing, without fear of retaliation. Know that the Robotics community will stand behind you, whatever your decision.
