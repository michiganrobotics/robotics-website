## Contact us

### Email
You can contact us via email at robotics-sso@umich.edu. Our team is committed to providing timely responses to all your questions and during peak advising times during the school year. Email may be the quickest way to receive a response, and is best for things like letter requests, waitlist inquiries, and other items that don't require an appointment.

### Phone
You can call us at **734-763-2369** and leave a message. Please include your full name, whether you are an undergraduate or graduate student, and your question. A SSO staff member will reach out to help you as soon as possible. 

### Appointments

Current University of Michigan students can schedule an advising appointment with an [Undergraduate Academic Advisor](/academics/undergraduate/advising/) or our [Graduate Coordinator](/academics/graduate/advising#graduate-program-coordinator).

## How to send announcements to our students

The Robotics department uses an announcement system that allows you to send your communication directly to our students.  If you would like to have your announcement sent to our students, please email the appropriate group(s) below directly with your announcement.

- ROB Undergraduate Students: rob-ugrad-students@umich.edu
- ROB Master's Students: rob-ms-students@umich.edu
- ROB Doctoral Students: rob-phd-students@umich.edu

*Announcements will be reviewed within 1-2 business days*

After emailing these groups the SSO staff will receive a request to approve your email.  If approved the email will be sent directly to our students and viewed as coming directly from you, the sender.  If denied, you will receive an email letting you know and the reason why.  Some reasons a message might be denied include:

<ul>
<li>Your message was deemed inappropriate for distribution to our students.</li>
<li>Your message was not formatted to be sent directly to students.  Please resubmit in a format addressed to the students you wish to send it to as if you were sending directly to them.</li>
</ul>

Tip: When sending, please write the email as if you are speaking directly to the students. Students will be able to reply directly to the email that you send your message from.

### Sending job opportunities for Robotics students
  Job postings should be sent to the <a href="https://career.engin.umich.edu/">Engineering Career Resource Center (ECRC)</a>. The Engineering Career Resource Center (ECRC) hosts an online system that allows you to post employment opportunities that will be easily accessible to all of our students. Visit the <a href="https://career.engin.umich.edu/employers/engagement/#jobs">ECRC Hire a Michigan Engineer</a> page to post your job.
