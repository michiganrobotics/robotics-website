    <p class="mt-0 text-xl max-w-2xl leading-relaxed">As one of the first undergraduate robotics programs at a top-ten engineering school, Michigan Robotics has developed cutting-edge courses that stay current with the fast-advancing robotics field.</p>
    <p class="text-lg max-w-3xl leading-relaxed">Robotics students gain an understanding of foundational concepts through *hands-on core courses* such as human-robot interaction, sensors and signals, and operating systems, then quickly *adapt the degree* to their interests with electives in areas such as robot control, autonomous robotics, wearable sensors, aircraft structres, or even marine dynamics.</p>
    <p class="text-lg max-w-3xl leading-relaxed">Leveraging the breadth of courses available across other top-ranked departments throughout the University, **a Michigan Robotics degree demonstrates the force-multiplying impact of the field** across a vast array of applications from medicine to manufacturing, and beyond.</p>

## What robotics students do

<div class="masonry-container lg:columns-2 lg:gap-6 mb-4">

<div class="surface rounded-lg p-6 mb-6 break-inside-avoid">

### Learn new concepts
While the robots may operate anywhere from underwater to outer space, the concepts underlying them remain the same. Students gain knowledge of these core technical areas:

* **Sensing** of the environment, external agents such as other robots or humans, and internal body information to infer and perceive the state of the world
* **Reasoning** with estimated models of the world to make decisions to accomplish tasks, satisfy goals, and learn from experience and interaction
* **Acting** upon its body and environment to produce motion or other outputs that enable the robot to achieve desired effects on the physical world and interact with people
* **Understanding** human and social dynamics, both quantitatively and qualitatively, for robots to effectively work with people and evaluate their impact on society

<div class="surface rounded-lg p-6 mb-6 break-inside-avoid">

### Build and compete
Beyond courses, students often dedicate a large portion of time to a student project team. Like FIRST Robotics, these teams typically have an international organizer that presents competition guidelines each year. Students work throughout the year on designing and building, then participate in international competitions.

### Grow and inspire community
Both within the U-M robotics community and greater society, students practice one of our [core values](/about/values): enthusiastic outreach. Robotics students can join others on the [Robotics Undergraduate Student Council](/academics/student-services/robotics-undergraduate-student-council) to plan outreach and community events and improve the entire program.

And robotics is one of the most exciting fields to see in action. We get regular requests from the community for tours, demonstrations, and other volunteering opportunities in which our students take part.
