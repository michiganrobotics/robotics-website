If you have a quick question that doesn’t require an advising appointment, you can email [robotics-sso@umich.edu](mailto:robotics-sso@umich.edu) or leave a message at 734-763-2369.

While waiting for a response or appointment:
* Make sure to review Robotics BSE [degree requirements and policies](/academics/undergraduate/degree-requirements).   
* Jump to more [general advising and academic tips](#general-advising-tips-for-robotics-majors).  
* See our advisor answers to [frequently asked robotics undergraduate questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C2yH4iB3OYoQRcv61bLOFCD7Wj-TIxx2t5rTvDrlXe8/edit?usp=sharing).

## Meeting with an advisor

### Schedule an appointment
You can schedule an advising appointment with Robotics to discuss things such as major exploration, course planning, degree requirements and progress, career opportunities, and declaring a major.

While Robotics students can meet with any advisor, the Robotics Undergraduate Academic Advisors organize their administrative responsibilities alphabetically, and students could consider meeting with the advisor in charge of their side of the alphabet as that advisor could be more familiar with their situation.

*Students whose last names begin with A-L are with Terran Davis. Students whose last names begin with M-Z are with Kyle Manley.*

### Drop-in advising
Undergraduate students only, Fall and Winter terms only  
Robotics Undergraduate Academic Advisors offer virtual drop-in advising appointments for ROB  and UM students who have quick questions pertaining to the Robotics undergraduate program and courses. The goal for each drop-in appointment is 8 to 10 minutes.

**Drop-in Fall 2025 Schedule:**
TBD

### ClariTea

Another great way to informally chat with an advisor and hang out with fellow students is a regularly offered event called ClariTea. Enjoy snacks and tea in 2000 FRB.

**ClariTea in Fall 2025 is offered:**

## General advising tips for Robotics majors

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-6">

<div class="surface rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">

**Discipline Breadth courses**  
Discipline Breadth courses are typically completed during the second and third years of the program. Each category offers multiple course options, giving you the flexibility to tailor your selections to your interests within robotics. Some courses may also double-count toward a second major or minor, depending on overlap. Be sure to check with an academic advisor to confirm double-counting policies.

</div>

<div class="surface rounded-lg p-6 mb-6 ">

**Robotics Core planning**  
When planning to complete the Robotics Core, we recommend taking no more than two 300-level ROB classes in a single semester. Many students have shared that these courses can be time-intensive due to their project-based nature. When building your schedule, consider your extracurricular commitments, research involvement, and overall course load to maintain a manageable balance.

</div>
<div class="surface rounded-lg p-6 mb-6 ">
**ROB 204: the gateway course**  
ROB 204 is considered the gateway course for upper-level robotics classes. Most students take it during their third semester, after completing the required courses to declare the Robotics major. Completing ROB 204 earlier allows you to access 300-level and 400-level ROB electives sooner.
</div>

<div class="surface rounded-lg p-6 mb-6 ">
**ROB 201: Calculus for the Modern Engineer**  
If you entered the program with AP/IB or dual-enrollment math credit and need an additional upper-level math course, consider taking ROB 201\. This course is geared toward first and second year students; it builds a strong mathematical foundation tailored to robotics applications. You can [learn more about ROB 201](https://grizzle.robotics.umich.edu/education/rob201.html).
</div>

<div class="surface rounded-lg p-6 mb-6 ">
**Degree audits**  
Degree Audits are a great tool for tracking your academic progress and ensuring you're meeting graduation requirements. This is the same system academic advisors use when reviewing your record. You can access your Degree Audit through Wolverine Access under the Student Center tab.
</div>

<div class="surface rounded-lg p-6 mb-6 ">
**Early engagement opportunities**  
First-year engineering students can engage with the Robotics Department while completing Engineering Common Core requirements. Courses such as ROB 101 (Linear Algebra), ROB 102 (Introduction to Programming/AI), and ENGR 100 Section 850 (Robotics Mechanisms) provide early exposure to key robotics concepts and help students explore their interest in the major.
</div>

<div class="surface rounded-lg p-6 mb-6 ">
**Intellectual Breadth & General Electives**  
Intellectual Breadth and General Electives are essential components of a well-rounded liberal arts education. They help students develop broad, transferable skills and perspectives that are valuable in the workforce. We suggest spreading these courses throughout your four-year plan. Taking too many in your first or second year can result in an unbalanced schedule later, when technical courses become more demanding.
</div>

<div class="surface rounded-lg p-6 mb-6 ">
**Meet with an advisor regularly**  
Meeting with an academic advisor at least once per semester is highly recommended. Advisors can support you with course planning, reviewing policies, exploring research or co-op opportunities, and ensuring you’re making satisfactory progress toward your degree.
</div>

<div class="surface rounded-lg p-6 mb-6 ">
**Create a four-year plan**  
Creating a four-year plan is an excellent way to visualize your academic journey. It can help you estimate the number of semesters needed to complete your degree and ensure that prerequisite courses and graduation requirements are scheduled appropriately.

## Sample & editable schedules

These sample schedules provide four different pathways for a Robotics Major:

## Robotics sample schedules

This section contains examples of eight-semester (four-year) plans to help students envision how requirements may fit together over their time at Michigan. Each plan is only a sample of what is possible.  It is not necessary to follow the plan suggested below exactly, but your degree progress must respect the prerequisite chains. 

These sample schedules provide four different pathways in mind for a Robotics Major:

## Departmental petitions

A Robotics undergraduate student may request an exception to the Robotics degree requirements or guidelines for a specific reason or circumstances [through our petition system](https://deptapps.engin.umich.edu/petition/student/form?dept=210308).

Note: if you are trying to enroll in a ROB course without meeting its enrollment requirements, please [use this Course Override request](https://deptapps.engin.umich.edu/robovr/enrlreq/new?dept=210308).

It is recommended that the student first consult with an academic advisor to determine if a petition is appropriate and what supporting materials could be necessary. Some common materials would be a syllabus for a course you wish to use towards a requirement, transcripts, email from instructor, etc. It is also recommended that students submit a petition *before* acting on the reason for the petition.

<div class="surface card card-padded">
### Instructions for completing the online petition form

* First select the “Type of Petition” that best describes your request.   
* Provide a description of the exception request.   
  * For example, “*I wish to request an exception to use a transfer credit: Math 201X, to count as Math 215*.”  
* Write a succinct but thorough rationale of why this exception should be made for you.  
  * For example, “*I studied abroad in the Summer of 20XX and took a course called Multivariable Calculus at the University of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. The Math department determined that this course was missing the following topics below in order to count as a Math 215 equivalent. I have covered these same topics in Math 4XX at the University of Michigan.*”  
* Attach any supporting documentation such as course syllabi or transfer credit evaluations.


After you submit your petition, the Robotics Undergraduate Academic Advisors and the Associate Undergraduate Chair will review your petition. You will be notified automatically via email when a final decision has been made. Processing time may take up to 3-4 weeks; expedited requests should be discussed with your advisor.
</div>

## College of Engineering petitions

The College of Engineering also has a petition process for select exceptions such as adding a course after the term has ended, withdrawing from a term after its end, reinstatement from Enrollment Withheld, and other exceptions to college rules can be found on the [Engineering Center for Academic Success website](https://ecas.engin.umich.edu/ssc/petitions/).
