Michigan is producing tomorrowâ€™s robotics leaders, and in addition to a top robotics graduate program, now has the first undergraduate robotics program among top-ten engineering schools.

Students design, create, analyze, and use embodied intelligences that interact with the physical and human environment. They study robotics and its place in the world, drawing on many fields of engineering, including computer science, mechanical engineering, artificial intelligence, computer vision, electrical engineering, control systems, human-robot interaction, and biomedical engineering.
