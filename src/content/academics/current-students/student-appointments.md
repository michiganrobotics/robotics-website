The Robotics Department relies on students to fill many job roles across the department. This includes:

- graduate student instructors (GSI)

- instructional aides (IA)

- peer advisors

- tutors

- graders

- building tour guides

If you would like to be considered for any of these roles, please fill out this [student appointment interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSceqqqvlggXnqCBez7g0JMylt8OK07eowNJ61Q7nAYYoW0Ujg/viewform?usp=sf_link).

## Additional Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) information

The application is open approximately July and November each year. The link will be shared to those who fill out the [student appointment interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSceqqqvlggXnqCBez7g0JMylt8OK07eowNJ61Q7nAYYoW0Ujg/viewform?usp=sf_link) and express interest in a GSI position.

A GSI coordinates, leads, or assists in the instructional process in direct interaction with students.  This can include class sessions, office hours, recitation, laboratory, quiz, or problem sessions. GSI positions are filled by both incoming and current graduate students. Doctoral students are given priority. GSIs are usually expected to work 16 to 20 hours per week, receiving full tuition and fees, monthly stipend, and university health care coverage.

**Application process:**  

- Students desiring a GSI position must take part in the departmental application process which takes place two times per year (typically November and July).
